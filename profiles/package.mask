# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
# d) the word "removal"
#
## Example:
##
## Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2012)
## Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## funny. (bug #987654)
## app-misc/some-package

# netcdf(-java) is horribly outdated, it requires dev-java/ehcache which is
# being removed. This ebuild cannot be moved into ::sci because the sources
# are no longer available outside of the Gentoo mirror. Newer versions of
# netcdf-java and ehcache use a maven based build system which currently does
# not work with portage. The only real solution would be to add a netcdf-bin
# package. If you need this software please complain on bugzilla or GitHub.
# Masked for removal when dev-java/ehcache is removed from ::gentoo (~30 days).
dev-java/netcdf
